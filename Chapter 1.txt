1.1 A register is a small high speed memory used to store temporary results and certain control information.
1.2 A proccessor follows the fetch-execute cycle reaptedly reading simple instructions from memory and executing them.
1.3 Integrated circuits consist of a proccessor, a memory and I/O interface. Different integrated circuits are connected by buses.
1.4 Integrated circuits connected by buses, each of them consist of a processor that communicates with memory to read instructions from and them execute them and finally can write result or read more instructions before execution via the I/O interface.
1.5/1.6 Machine language has a one to one relationship with the assembly language, the assembly language programmer can write code in a human readable and understandable format which reduces the difficulty and adds a layer of abstraction from machine's language which basically consists only of zeros and ones.
1.7 Assembly language should be used when writing critical programs for embedded systems that have little memory and timing problems. Also, for machine-specific operations in an operating system kernel.
